in this procedure i want to return all the employees from a specific branch

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.sp_GetAllEmpHan
AS 
BEGIN
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName 
FROM HanleyEmp
END

Now i will execute this procedure by using the below 
EXEC sp_GetAllEmpHan
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in this next procedure i want to limit the results by lastname, I will do this by passing in a variable 

CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.spGetAllEmpHanByLastName
	@LastName VARCHAR (40)
AS 
BEGIN
	SELECT EmployeeID, Firstname, Lastname 
	FROM HanleyEmp
	WHERE Lastname = @LastName;
END 

when i execute this procedure, i will be expected to pass in a parameter 
EXEC spGetAllEmpHanByLastName 'Nutt'
