-- In this file i will use the GameStore database as an example

Here i want to find out who is the Manager of the Hanley Branch by combining the HanleyEmployees table with the Branch table 
SELECT HanleyEmployees.EmployeeID, HanleyEmployees.FirstName + HanleyEmployees.LastName AS ManagerName 
FROM HanleyEmployees
JOIN Branch
ON HanleyEmployees.EmployeeID = Branch.ManagerID
